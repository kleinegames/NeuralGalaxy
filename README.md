The galaxy research project 

We are using machine learning techniques on a dataset provided by the EAGLE simulations to build interesting machine learning models, and learn more about the field of astronomy. 

Our research goals:
- identify the shape of a galaxy based on a picture --convulational neural network--
- estimate the specific star formation rate of a galaxy using a picture --fit a line on the dataset-- 
- train a pixel to pixel neural network to generate maps which show the distribution of properties within a galaxy -- ?? --

Don't worry, fancy logo coming soon
